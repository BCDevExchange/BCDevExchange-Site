         Code with Us is our experiment to find a faster, easier, and more effective way for Government to get and pay for code and other artifacts related to a digital service. Using micro-purchases and open source licenses, we’re paying a fixed price for code and artifacts that meet agreed upon acceptance criteria.</p>

        <h2>What's New</h2>
        <p class="lead">We’ve just introduced a couple of changes based on the feedback we’ve had from participants:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Opportunities up to $5,000 in value. (We’ll be working to raise that amount higher in the coming months, too.)</li>
          <li>A formal assignment process.</li></ol>
          </p>
