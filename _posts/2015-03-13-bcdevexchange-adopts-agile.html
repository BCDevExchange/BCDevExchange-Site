<p><span style="color: #000000">The <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> development team has adopted the Agile Methodology and Lean startup theory. To better guide our development work we are inviting users to join in with us and become part of the BCDevExchange community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Getting Agile</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We empowered the development team to work in 2-week sprints, problem solving and delivering software features that users can test. These software features will be minimum viable products – just enough working software for users to test whether they like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> We believe it’s better to ‘fail fast’ and that user experience (UX) research and design is fundamental to getting things right. We want the UX work to provide quality assurance up-front and be timed to feed into the development team’s sprint planning sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Hearing the User</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> We are initiating the formation of two user groups to give us feedback at the tactical level. One group will help us imagine and design the future of the product. Our plan is to convene this group and workshop the construction of a product backlog to help us imagine what the product will look like in six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> We are looking for interested people who can contribute to the future design and who will grow with us as the BCDevExchange matures. For optimal use of their time, we figure the community needs to come together every three months or so.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> A second group is intended to evaluate what we’ve done and provide user experience feedback on newly-minted software features created by the BCDevExchange development team. They will test the specifics of what we have developed, and let us refine the product we are making.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Get Involved</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> How can you get involved?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> We are looking for developers and UX designers to join and help us evaluate work on-the-fly housed in GitHub and on the software features within the BCDevExchange website. We’ll be looking to form this community in the ensuing few weeks. <a href="mailto:data@gov.bc.ca">Contact us</a> if you are interested.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> And please tell us your thoughts by leaving a comment on the blog. Does this agile approach resonate?</span></p>
