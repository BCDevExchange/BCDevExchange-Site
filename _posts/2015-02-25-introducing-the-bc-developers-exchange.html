<p><span style="color: #000000">What if brilliant developers could use real-time data feeds to create mobile phone transit apps to locate moving buses?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The solution would be a win-win-win. Public transit organizations could provide a data feed showing where buses are located, industry could develop mobile phone apps, and customers who use the apps would get a better transit experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A search of mobile phone app stores will show that for parts of B.C., the transit example is reality – been there, done that!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">How many more success stories could come to life if there was a way to easily repeat the pattern? What if B.C.’s technology industry and B.C.’s public sector could regularly engage in the co-creation, co-development and rapid adoption of innovation?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Enter the BC Developers&#8217; Exchange Framework or <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a>. We aim to make it easier to innovate and to experiment – to take an idea from concept to reality by testing, trialing, refining and collaborating between the B.C. public sector and the tech sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The BCDevExchange encourages B.C.’s world-class technology industry to use the digital resources of the B.C. public sector to help them develop commercial products and to expand market opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It’s a way to help grow B.C.’s technology industry simply by leveraging the B.C. public sector – its resources and unmet needs for innovative products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The BCDevExchange Approach</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> is a project in its early (alpha) stage. We have ideas, concepts, examples and lots of interesting conversations with people inside and outside the project. We’re using lean start-up theory, which means we’re treating project ideas as unproven assumptions that need to be explored and tested in case we need to adjust our thinking or development work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The BCDevExchange Vision</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">BCDevExchange is exploring the idea of enabling an ecosystem of co-creation, commercialization and rapid adoption of innovation between the B.C. technology industry and the B.C. public sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We think BCDevExchange should be about making it easy for:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000">B.C.’s technology industry to use the digital resources of the B.C. public sector in their own commercial developments;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">B.C.’s public sector organizations to rapidly adopt industry-developed innovations for service and operational improvement; and</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">B.C.’s technology industry and B.C.’s public sector to collaborate, co-create and co-develop new products and services for sustained results.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Easy Access to Digital Resources</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">B.C.’s public sector is a major employer comprising over 400 organizations covering a diverse spectrum of services involving over 5-million clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A consequence of the size of the B.C. public sector is that it holds the potential for a rich storehouse of “digital resources” that could be relevant to industry-based developers. The term “digital resources” is an easy way to reference things like data in digital form, computer source code, technical specifications, reference implementations and computer programmable interfaces for data and services (web APIs).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">While there is potential for industry to leverage the digital resources of the B.C. public sector, the way it currently works makes examples few and far between. We hear about this regularly from people in B.C.’s technology industry. They say it would take too long, cost too much and involve too much complexity and overhead. This assessment is often shared by B.C. public sector organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> aims to stimulate growth in B.C.’s technology industry by engaging the public in the routine development of products and services to leverage B.C. public sector digital resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Rapid Adoption of Innovation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">B.C. public sector organizations can see the potential to improve their services and organizational performance through the application of innovative technology. They can see a win for their organizations and for their clients if they could flexibly and rapidly adopt industry innovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The reality is B.C. public sector organizations are obligated to adhere to a model for selection of information technology that does not support rapid adoption. This model does not reflect the size and importance of B.C.’s technology industry, the pervasiveness of information technology within our society or its ever-changing nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But the time, cost, and complexity and overhead associated with the current model are effective deterrents that repel and discourage rapid adoption by the B.C. public sector of industry’s products and services. This can be especially true when it comes to the entrepreneurial, startup and small business sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">BCDevExchange aims to remove the barriers to rapid adoption, and rapid realization of benefits for B.C. public sector organizations and BC’s technology industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Collaboration, Co-creation, Co-Development</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> intends to make it easier for the B.C. public sector – provincial ministries, Crown agencies and municipalities – to work with and leverage the expertise of the tech sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Currently, the public sector does not know what public sector digital resources industry values, and industry does not know what digital resources the public sector has. Collaboration is needed to solve this chicken-and-egg problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">BCDevExchange intends to develop an improved engagement model between the B.C. technology industry and B.C. public sector, one that the tech industry supports because it has been expressly designed to work for them, and one that benefits participating public sector organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And we are starting from the ground up. We will co-create BCDevExchange by working directly with BC’s tech industry and public sector organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Get Involved</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We need your help. Are you a developer, tech entrepreneur, public sector employee or interested citizen? We want to hear from you on<a style="color: #000000" href="http://bcdevexchange.org"> BCDevExchange</a>.</span></p>
