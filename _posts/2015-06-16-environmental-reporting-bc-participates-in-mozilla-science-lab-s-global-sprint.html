<p><span style="color: #000000">At <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/">Environmental Reporting BC</a>, we embrace openness. We share our methods, data and code underlying the Province’s State of the Environment report. We do this so others can replicate and evaluate our work, and to foster collaboration with other scientists inside and outside the public service, including providing opportunities to contribute if they desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Global Sprint for Open Science</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Last Friday, June 5th was a perfect example of what is possible. I collaborated with members of the broad “open science” community as part of the <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2015">Mozilla Science Lab&#8217;s Global Sprint</a> . This was an event organized by the <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a>, an organization that is &#8220;helping a global network of researchers, tool developers, librarians and publishers collaborate to further science on the web.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">During the two-day Sprint (similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>) people from all over the world gathered, both physically and virtually, to work together on software projects to help advance open science and education. There were 30 Sprint sites or ‘hubs’ in 10 different countries across the globe, with over 40 active projects. Check out the complete list of projects, sites, and participants <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-2015globalsprint">here</a>, and a short summary <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/you-did-this-mozilla-science-global-sprint-2015">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Building Open Lesson Plans Using BC Government Data and Code</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I joined a great group of people at the Vancouver hub hosted at Mozilla by <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/u/billmills">Bill Mills</a>, community manager at Mozilla Science. There were lots of great projects underway, some of which you can read about in this <a href="http://www.tiffanytimbers.com/Coding.html">post</a> by fellow sprinter Tiffany Timbers. I was part of a small group that took on the task of creating <a href="https://github.com/BillMills/BCenviroLessons">coding lessons with open data from DataBC</a>. Bill Mills and Evan Morien put together a short script on <a href="https://github.com/BillMills/BCenviroLessons/blob/master/basic_tidying/basicTidying.R">basic data tidying in R</a>—free software for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display—using <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/air-quality-monitoring-raw-hourly-data-and-station-data">air quality data</a> from DataBC. <a href="https://github.com/aammd">Andrew MacDonald</a> and I developed a lesson on <a href="https://github.com/aammd/BCenviroLessons/blob/exploring-data/data_exploration/explore_grizzly_data.md">data cleaning and visualizing spatial data with R</a>, again using open data from DataBC: Grizzly bear <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/2012-grizzly-bear-population-estimates">population estimates</a>, <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/history-of-grizzly-bear-mortalities">mortality history</a> and <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-units">spatial population units</a>. The lesson plans we worked on at the Sprint will help people learn and teach some of the tools of open science, such as <a href="http://r-project.org">R</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Policy Innovation Drives Tech Collaboration</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">All of this is possible because organizations, individuals and governments, including the Province of B.C., are providing public access to their digital resources. Environmental Reporting BC makes our data available in the DataBC Data Catalogue under the <a href="http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/local/dbc/docs/license/OGL-vbc2.0.pdf">Open Government License</a>, which allows anybody to use it for their needs with very few limitations. Because of this, members of the Mozilla Science community could freely use the air quality data and grizzly bear data to develop the lesson plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">More recently, the <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org">BC Developers Exchange</a> opened the door to enhanced government transparency and collaboration by getting the <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/the-province-of-bc-on-github/">Province of B.C.</a> onto <a href="https://github.com/bcgov">GitHub</a>, and allowing us to publish <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/EnvReportBC-RepoList">our own open source code</a> and participate in other open source projects. As a result, I was able to help develop these lessons that anybody can use, contribute to and modify to their own needs. This is just one example of how these tools that we now have at our disposal can help foster collaboration between government and scientists, technologists, industry, academia and the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Get Involved</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We are excited about the opportunities to engage and collaborate. If you are curious about the work we do, or just want to share your thoughts, we want to hear from you. Find us on <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/EnvReportBC-RepoList">GitHub</a>, on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/EnvReportBC">@EnvReportBC</a> or by posting a message below on this blog.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Many thanks to the Mozilla Science Lab, and Bill Mills in particular, for hosting the event and taking on the B.C. environment data lessons as a Sprint project.</span></p>
