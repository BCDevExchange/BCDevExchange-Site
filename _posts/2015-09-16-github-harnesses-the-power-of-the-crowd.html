<p><span style="color: #000000">As any coder will tell you, sometimes code breaks. Normally, fixing broken code falls on the original coder who needs to carve out time in their busy schedule. A fix can take time depending on how much other work a coder has.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But there is another way. Enter <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the popular online code sharing community. Operating on the principle that many hands make light work, GitHub harnesses the power of the crowd by matching coding work with an army of coders so broken code can be fixed faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Here’s a real world example of GitHub in action.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>‘Git’ the Advantage</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">For public servant and scientist turned coder Andy Teucher, broken code meant more work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As part of the <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/environment">Ministry of Environment’s</a> <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/">Environmental Reporting BC</a> team, Andy writes <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R code</a> to analyze environmental data. R code helps make sense of the data, so Environmental Reporting BC can publically report on environmental indicators in B.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">One of Andy’s R code packages analyzed groundwater data. When the changes were made to the server that stored the data, the code broke.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A fix would have to wait, as Andy had higher priority work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But Environmental Reporting BC had an advantage. As a <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/charting-a-new-path-environmental-reporting-bc-and-code-sharing/">BCDev pathfinder</a>, they had shared this <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater">R code on GitHub</a>, which <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/the-province-of-bc-on-github/">the Province of B.C. joined in the spring</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Once he became aware the code was broken, Andy posted an <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater/issues/5">issue</a> in GitHub to let everyone know what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This was no mea culpa, it was an opportunity. For those not familiar with GitHub (see the 101 below), you can tag an issue as “help wanted.” Once you post an issue,</span> <span style="color: #000000">it is viewable by the millions of developers on GitHub.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In this case, a civic-minded software developer read the issue, and after a conversation with Andy on GitHub, fixed the code.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Maximizing Collaboration</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is exactly the kind of behaviour the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/home">BCDevExchange encourages</a>. By collaborating in the open with software developers, government can rapidly develop quality tech solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In this case, a generous coder was prepared to offer their help for free. For that, Andy and the BC Developer’s Exchange team are really grateful – especially for how fast the fix happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>How can we encourage developers to collaborate on government IT projects?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">What’s required for this scenario to be more commonplace? We applaud those civic-minded developers who volunteer their time and expertise to help make government better. But we recognize that developers may not want to freely contribute to every government GitHub project.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">So we are exploring options to encourage developers to collaborate so development can happen more quickly than is currently possible and be rewarded for their effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">What do you think? How could developers be rewarded for their efforts? Can there be rewards while allowing for the same kind of rapid development that occurred in this example?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Let us know what you think. Post a comment on this blog, or if you prefer email us at <a href="mailto:data@gov.bc.ca">data@gov.bc.ca</a></span></p>

<h2><strong>GitHub 101</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub is a powerful online tool to collaborate with software developers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">Repos</a></strong></p>
<p>If you want to collaborate with other developers to improve your software application, everything starts with a GitHub repository, or ‘repo’. Create a repo and share the master software code for your application under an open-source license, which grants developers permission to work on the code.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/">Issues</a></strong></p>
<p>The next step is to post an issue in the repo. This gives developers an outline of the work to be done.  Examples include asking for help to fix a software bug or add a new feature to your application. Once developers know what needs to be done, they make a copy of your code, or ‘fork’ it. They modify it with new code to address the issue identified (e.g. fix the bug, add a feature, etc.).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a></strong></p>
<p>When the developer has finished the work, they notify you by sending a ‘pull’ request with the modified code. The final step is for you to review the developer’s proposed changes and to decide whether or not to accept the modified code to replace your master code.</p>
