<p><span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/">Environmental Reporting BC</a> has published code in GitHub. We are a pathfinder project in the <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a>, an experiment led by the Province of B.C. intended to create space for collaboration and innovation between tech entrepreneurs and British Columbia&#8217;s public sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What Are We Publishing?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/"> Environmental Reporting BC</a> is the Province’s approach to state of the environment reporting, sharing data, analysis and information on key environmental <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators">topics</a>. Our web-based model strives to serve the varied needs of our <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2013/03/environmental-reporting-bc-engages-citizens-on-the-environment/">audiences</a>, provide timely, open, and dynamic reports on the environment that are easy to access and understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> We are moving our code – the scripts we write to get, prepare, analyse and present environmental data and information into the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov">Province’s GitHub space</a>. GitHub is an online collaborative platform widely used to share and collaborate on code and other content. The Province of B.C. is a newcomer to <a href="https://github.com/bcgov">GitHub</a> but as a start, you will find an <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater/">package</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/groundwater_levels">analysis code</a></span> <span style="color: #000000">behind our ‘</span><a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/water/wells/index.html">Long-term Trends in Groundwater Levels in B.C</a><span style="color: #000000">.’</span> <span style="color: #000000">indicator. Expect more to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Pathfinder Project</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Environmental Reporting BC and the BCDevExchange share key principles, like <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/about/">openness</a>, <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/how-to-deal-with-not-knowing-bcdevexchanges-4-principles/">collaboration</a>, and <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/how-to-deal-with-not-knowing-bcdevexchanges-4-principles/">learning by doing</a>. In the spirit of these principles and continuous experimentation, Environmental Reporting BC is charting a new path as a pathfinder project of the BCDevExchange. The goal is to share our experience with other public sector organizations interested in moving into this space.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"> Since its inception, Environmental Reporting BC has embraced openness. We <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/plants-and-animals/native-vertebrate-species_methods.html">share our methods</a>. and make the <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?q=%22environmental+reporting%22&amp;download_audience=Public&amp;sort=score+desc%2C+record_publish_date+desc">data underlying our analyses</a> available on DataBC under the <a href="http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/local/dbc/docs/license/OGL-vbc2.0.pdf">Open Government License – British Columbia</a>. This includes the <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?tags=Environmental+Reporting+BC">groundwater data</a> used with the R package in GitHub. For us, making the R package and analysis code available is a natural continuation of our commitment to openness and transparency, a ‘fork’ in the same road that will hopefully lead to more opportunities for collaboration and two-way conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>More to Come</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000"> Stay tuned to this space; Environmental Reporting BC will be blogging as we move more of our code into the Provinces&#8217; <a style="color: #000000" href="https://github.com/bcgov">GitHub</a> space. You will see more R packages, our code-based tools, and more analysis code supporting topics like air quality, or the <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/plants-and-animals/native-vertebrate-species.html">status of animals in British Columbia</a> and climate change. Our code-sharing vision is to promote increased transparency and collaboration for environmental reporting, across the province and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you have feedback on this new experiment, or thoughts to share, please leave us a comment. We are listening. And please, fork us on GitHub. You can also reach us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/envreportbc">@EnvReportBC</a>.</span></p>
