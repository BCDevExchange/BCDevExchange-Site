<p><span style="color: #000000">By Todd Wilson, Senior Enterprise Architect, Office of the Chief Information Officer</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The Province of British Columbia has joined <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as part of the <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> experiment. The Province has set up an <a href="https://github.com/bcgov">organisation on GitHub</a> where all of the Province’s open collaboration will be housed. If you don’t know it, no worries—GitHub is a social software coding service that lets people keep track of different versions of what they are making, typically software code. It supports comments, document management, and feature requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>T</strong><strong>ooling up for Open Collaboration</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">GitHub is the most widely-used community for open collaboration on source code files and boasts a community of nearly four million people sharing code in millions of repositories.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We are going to where the community is—but our start with GitHub is really modest. In the spirit of experimentation, it’s going to be a tool and a practice we are going to need to learn about.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The kind of open collaboration GitHub is designed to foster can be really powerful. Most of us have learned the basics of “share and share alike” and “many hands make light work.”  Recognizing these two really simple ideas work phenomenally well together, the tech sector has used open collaboration on technology projects since the very first days of the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The potential to bring the skills and ideas of private sector companies, provincial government ministries, individual developers and broader public sector bodies like Crown Corporations and municipalities make it a great way to test the ideas behind the</span> <span style="color: #000000"><a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/introducing-the-bc-developers-exchange/">BCDevExchange experiment</a>—particularly our ability to not only share code, but accept changes from others.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Baby steps</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We are at the early stages of operating in this space, so we are moving into GitHub step-by-step. For now, you won’t see a rush of new projects in our repositories. There’s a lot to think about—from managing intellectual property to applying the <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/citz/citizens_engagement/some_guidelines_master.pdf">B.C. Social Media Guidelines</a> and providing guidance to our employees about using the tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the meantime, you are invited to check out what we have on GitHub so far. The BCDevExchange will learn by doing, so we are working on some early adopter or “pathfinder” projects that will teach us about sharing public sector code and accepting contributions back from those outside government. The BCDevExchange experiment is one of these pathfinders and is available at:</span> <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange">https://GitHub.com/BCDevExchange</a><span style="color: #000000">. We expect to pick up speed, adding more pathfinders as we go. If your B.C. public sector organization has a potential pathfinder project, <a href="mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca">we</a></span><a href="mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca"> would love to hear from you.</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This is a very exciting time as we apply the spirit of open collaboration to public sector technology development.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you have thoughts to share, please leave us a comment.</span></p>
