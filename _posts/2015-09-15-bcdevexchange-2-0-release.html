<p><span style="color: #000000">Today, we launched a new iteration of the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/home">BCDevExchange website</a> with new features to help B.C.’s public and tech sectors collaborate and experiment together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We believe collaboration between B.C.’s public and tech sector is a win-win – it will lead to better information technology products and services, which can be used by British Columbians, and help seed growth in one of the province’s key economic sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">So what are the new features? The significant change is the introduction of profiles of early adopters who embrace the BCDevExchange vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Meet the Early Adopters</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Each early adopter has a profile page – a place where you will find digital resources and related documentation, and in some cases invitations to collaborate on technology development. Without further ado, our early adopters are:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Laws">The BC Laws API</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The <a href="http://www.pss.gov.bc.ca/printing/printing.html">Queen’s Printer of British Columbia</a> has shared their <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/index.html">BC Laws API</a>, an XML feed of all provincial legislation, under a license that empowers commercial use for some time. As part of the BCDevExchange they are using the <a href="http://wso2.com/landing/ppc/api-manager/?gclid=CIPl5IiF98cCFUhhfgod_WwFrg">WSO2 open source API manager</a> to experiment with a new way to present their API. We think developers will be keenly interested in this approach to explore an API. Check it out <a href="https://api.bcdevexchange.org/apim/store/apis/info?name=BCLaws&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;provider=admin#!/content/get_content_aspectId_get_0">here</a> and let us know what you think.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The BC Laws API team also started a <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api">GitHub repo</a> with an eye towards future collaborative development. This may include improving the BC Laws API, and exploring an API for municipal bylaws. A standardized B.C. platform for legislative information would allow developers to re-use functionality across jurisdictions in the province and offer value-added applications for citizens attempting to interact with the laws and bylaws that govern them. We all love PDFs but think of the value to small business owners of smartphone-enabled local bylaws, instead of trying to find and read a PDF on a smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/City%20of%20Kamloops">City of Kamloops</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The <a href="http://www.kamloops.ca/index.shtml">City of Kamloops</a> has joined the BCDevExchange, profiling their open data which is now under the Open Government License &#8211; British Columbia. They are <a href="https://api.bcdevexchange.org/apim/store/apis/info?name=KamloopsGarbagePickup&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;provider=admin">experimenting with us on presenting data via API</a> and looking for opportunities to collaborate with the local tech community. Collaboration is already underway. Driven by the tech accelerator <a href="http://kamloopsinnovation.ca/">Kamloops Innovation</a>, developers in Kamloops are exploring the potential of developing a <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/garbage-day">waste reminder pickup service</a> for city residents. We look forward to watching this project progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Data%20Catalogue">BC Data Catalogue</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The team at <a href="http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/">DataBC</a> is profiling the<a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public"> BC Data Catalogue</a>, both the catalogue content, and the Province of B.C.’s code contributions. Built on the open source software project <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> code base, the BC Data Catalogue’s <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/ckanext-bcgov">code is available under an open source license on GitHub</a>. The future includes exploring open development to improve the catalogue and give back to the community. For more details about the launch of the catalogue read this <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/databcs-new-tip-top-data-stop/">blog</a> and be sure to check out the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Data%20Catalogue">profile page.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Physical%20Address%20Geocoder">BC Physical Address Geocoder</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Also from DataBC, is a <a href="http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/dbc/geographic/locate/geocoding.page?">geocoding web service </a>which offers a REST API. Using data from a variety of government sources and an innovative algorithm, the Geocoder turns addresses into physical locations (i.e. longitude and latitude points) and standardizes the address text as a useful by-product.  Learn more about the Geocoder API on the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Physical%20Address%20Geocoder">profile page</a>, and check out the <a href="https://api.bcdevexchange.org/apim/store/apis/info?name=Geocoder&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;provider=admin">experiment with WSO2 as an API manager</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/City%20of%20Surrey">City of Surrey</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A leader in the provincial open data space, the <a href="http://www.surrey.ca/">City of Surrey</a> is staying nimble. Their <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/City%20of%20Surrey">profile page</a> highlights the data in their <a href="http://www.surrey.ca/city-services/658.aspx">open data catalogue</a>, which can be accessed by APIs. Like the BC Data Catalogue, their catalogue code is based on CKAN, so you can find their <a href="https://github.com/CityofSurrey/ckanext-surrey">code contributions in GitHub</a>. They are also exploring open development in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">For all the news on the big release of the <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/transportation-and-infrastructure">Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s</a> Open 511 API, read the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2015TRAN0118-001511">news releas</a>e. Developed in partnership with the non-profit <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/">Open North</a>, <a href="http://www.open511.org/">Open 511 is an API standard</a> for provincial highway travel information, including road closures, planned work and extreme weather conditions. It is released under a license that grants commercial use. Check out their <a href="http://api.open511.gov.bc.ca/help">production API</a> and an <a href="https://api.bcdevexchange.org/apim/store/apis/info?name=OPEN511&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;provider=admin">experimental version in WSO2</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>User Testing of Profile Pages</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In keeping with the BCDevExchange ethos of collaboration, we have not developed the concept or design of the profile pages in a vacuum. We conducted lightweight user testing on the profile pages with developers. They are the primary audience, so it’s important that the profile pages are useful to them. We will continue to user test and refine these pages.</span></p>
