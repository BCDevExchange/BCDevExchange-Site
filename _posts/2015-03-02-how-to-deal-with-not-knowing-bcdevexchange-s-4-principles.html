<p><span style="color: #000000">One of the reasons it’s exciting to be part of the <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> project is that it’s a journey—we know <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/introducing-the-bc-developers-exchange/">where we want to go</a>, but what we find along the way is still to be discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As open and full of possibility as that sounds (and is), the rub comes when decisions need to be made about options that look equally good—or not so good.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To guide our decisions, we will rely on principles. Strong principles ground us when faced with a tough decision, and stand as a test to make sure even the easy decisions stay on track. Principles help a team gel, and get the work done faster. And from the perspective of people outside the project team, principles also help hold that team accountable for doing the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As we take our first steps into creating BCDevExchange, we’d like your feedback on our guiding principles. Build on them. Challenge them. Re-direct them. We are committed to listening so we can invent a program that meets the needs of the people it’s supposed to serve. If you’re reading, that’s you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">So here they are, four principles that will guide the BC Developer’s Exchange:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><em>Think like a startup</em>—we are creating a new product, and we need to work out how to take it to market. We can accomplish this by learning from the startup community about how to stay agile, work iteratively and stay relevant to the entrepreneurs we believe will be our customers. We do not claim to be experts in this approach, but we are lucky to have mentors on the <a href="http://www.bcic.ca/">BC Innovation Council</a> willing to help.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><em>Remove barriers— </em>our job is to facilitate access to digital resources like data, source code and APIs across the public sector in a way that creates opportunities for businesses here in B.C. We need to remove barriers to simplify access. We need to ask ourselves: are doing all we can, in the simplest way we can?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><em>Maximize collaboration—</em>BCDevExchange will not succeed if it is designed within the walls of government and unveiled to a surprised business community. We need to get close to our customers – industry, core government and the broader public sector – and work with them to co-create this program.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><em>Maintain government’s responsibility—</em>there are crucial responsibilities the B.C. government needs to maintain, especially around security, privacy protection and public accountability. Our partners need to understand our limits, and it is up to us to communicate them.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Are we missing a fifth principle? Something about these four that needs to change or isn’t clear? Share your thoughts and advice in the comments. We’re excited to hear from you.</span></p>
