<p><span style="color: #000000">A <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2016/01/pay-for-pull/">few weeks ago we setup an experiment</a> to test a new procurement model.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Called ‘Pay for Pull,’ this new model is all about learning how we can deliver on a key value proposition of the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/home">BCDevExchange</a> – making it easier for the province’s tech sector to work with government organizations in British Columbia.  ‘Pay for Pull’ is one experiment to explore new ways we could attract developers to work on public sector tech challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But experimenting with procurement is not our only focus. The BCDevExchange wants to encourage public sector organizations to become reference customers for local tech companies who can then take their product to the international market.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We also want to share public sector APIs, data, and code that entrepreneurs can use. Read on to learn about Knomos, a Vancouver-based startup that is a great example of an entrepreneur building a business using public sector digital resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>‘Pay for Pull’ &#8211; Starting Small</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In the experiment, the government’s <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/Citizen%20Engagement%20Web%20Toolkit">Citizen Engagement team</a> posted 3 specific software development needs as issues on GitHub, one of the most used websites for software development and collaboration. All 3 issues needed code to improve people’s experience when participating in an online public consultation. Each issue offered a fixed payment of $1,000 for the best code submitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The Citizen Engagement team’s websites use WordPress, a popular open source software, so we figured many developers would have the skills to do the work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What Happened</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We had some important questions; would developers work with government in this way? Would they submit high quality code? Would they see this as an easier way to work with government?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It’s early days, but the initial results are promising.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">With only minor publicity about the test, developers engaged. They told us what they liked and where process improvements could be made and asked good technical questions to understand what needed to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Better yet, they responded with quality code. For <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/issues/5#issuecomment-183101307">one of the issues</a>, the Citizen Engagement team merged a pull request with solid code that met the acceptance criteria. A day later, the developer was paid $1,000 via PayPal. We have also just <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/issues/7">merged a second pull request</a>, and payment is forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Pull requests have also been received for <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/issues/6">the last issue</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What We Heard</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We also learned that some developers are concerned ‘Pay for Pull,’ could entice multiple developers to work on the same issue, with only one ultimately being successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">While developers retain the intellectual property rights to the code they submit, we respect this very real concern &#8211; no one wants a duplication of effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In response to this concern, we simply asked developers to let everyone know they were working on an issue by posting in the comment section of the issue. Our thinking was that other developers would be less likely to work on the same issue, if they knew someone else was already working on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As the test progresses, we will learn what we can about any potential challenges and continue to actively listen and respond to community feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What’s Next?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The experiment continues. On March 2, 2016, we launched <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api/issues/4">a new Pay for Pull opportunity</a> from the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BC%20Laws">innovators at the Queen’s Printer of British Columbia, who are responsible for the BC Laws API</a>, a data feed for all provincial laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Published under a permissive license, the BC Laws API is free for anyone to use, including for commercial purposes. It has been a vital raw ingredient for <a href="http://knomos.ca/">Knomos</a>, a legal research startup that was recently announced <a href="http://knomos.ca/microsoft-ventures-accelerator-we-have-liftoff/">as one of 10 tech companies in North America selected for the accelerator, Microsoft Ventures</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Knomos is an example of another value proposition of the BCDevExchange &#8211; sharing government’s digital resources to seed business opportunities for B.C. tech entrepreneurs. Knomos is a testament to what is possible when government shares digital resources with entrepreneurs who see market opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We could not be more excited to have the BC Laws team as our next Pay for Pull opportunity. They have been an inspiration for us since the beginning.  The aim of the BCDevExchange is to make the story of collaboration between the BC Laws API team and Knomos more commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Scaling Up</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If we can prove that it’s possible to conduct transactions this way, likely the next experiment is to take what worked, to try larger-scale transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We’re asking ourselves how we could bundle multiple issues together for higher value transactions, and set up a way to qualify developers for larger amounts of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As always, we invite your feedback on this blog and the experiment. Let us know what you think.</span></p>
