<p><span style="color: #000000">On a night when the Canucks opened the playoffs, over 60 entrepreneurs, developers and open data aficionados congregated to hear about the BCDevExchange at the meetup organized by the non-profit <a href="https://www.opendatabc.ca/">OpenDataBC</a> with support from <a href="http://www.pixelcrafters.ca/">Vancouver Pixel Crafters</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Project co-lead Peter Watkins pitched the BCDevExchange as an opportunity to seed business opportunities for the province’s tech sector. This would be done by sharing government’s code, data and APIs, and by adopting innovations from industry back into government.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To help us explore the idea, we had tech heavy hitters and experienced users of government’s digital resources present. Our panel moderator was Keith Ippel, the co-founder of the <a href="http://spring.is/">Spring</a>, which helps startups get off the ground. Ippel brings over 15-years experience growing small and large companies such as Hootsuite, Lat49, KPMG and HUB Cycling. On our expert panel we had Mischa Steiner-Jovic, the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.awesense.com/">Awesense</a>, a company that provides intel on energy losses in their electrical grids to utilities around the world. Steiner-Jovic spoke of the challenge to get access to utility data for his company. The co-founder &amp; CEO of startup <a href="http://www.knomos.ca/">Knomos</a>, Adam LaFrance shared his experience of building a visual legal research tool that leverages the <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/index.html">BC Laws API</a>, which is a digital resource licensed by the Province’s Queen’s Printer for commercial use. Entrepreneur and open data leaderHerb Lainchbury of OpenDataBC advocated government continue to unlock valuable data from behind paywalls.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">The event generated spirited discussion and encouragement for the initial steps the Province is making. The mention of <a href="https://github.com/bcgov">the Province’s entry into GitHub</a> – a key tool the tech sector uses to collaborate on code development – drew a round of applause. At the meetup, entrepreneur Boris Mann put out a call-to-action to the community to show their support by engaging with the <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange">BCDevExchange in GitHub</a>.</span></p>
