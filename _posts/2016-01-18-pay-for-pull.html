<p><span style="color: #000000">How can we make it easier for innovators in B.C.’s tech sector and government to work together?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Traveling around the province, we’ve heard from the tech sector that they need simpler, faster ways to work with government to seize opportunities. We’ve also heard from government agencies that they want to tap into the rich talent and innovative ideas of B.C.’s tech sector, an infusion that could help improve government’s services.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">What’s needed is the right model to help innovation flow&#8211; creating better services for British Columbians, and giving B.C. tech businesses a chance at a powerful reference customer in a government agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">That’s why the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/home">BC Developers’ Exchange (BCDevExchange)</a> is experimenting with faster alternatives to traditional service contracts for software development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000">More code – less paperwork</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Run by a group of public service innovators, the BCDevExchange <a href="https://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/introducing-the-bc-developers-exchange/">started in 2015 with a vision to transform how government engages B.C.’s tech sector.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We are about to launch what we call “Pay for Pull,” our most ambitious experiment to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The idea behind “Pay for Pull’ is to lower the amount of administrative paperwork for government agencies and external software developers to work together. Instead of paperwork, we want time and effort focused on making the code that powers our digital services better.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000">What is “Pay for Pull”?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Essentially it’s cash for code. We create an issue in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the popular code sharing platform, and label it with ‘Help Wanted” and ‘$1000’. In the issue we will explain what we want done, sparking conversation between government technical staff and developers interested in doing the work. Interested developers can do the work and send us their code in GitHub – using a pull request. If we accept the code, we pay the developer $1000 via PayPal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">That’s the Coles Notes version. For more information on how it works please read <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/rapid-adoption/wiki">our Wiki</a>. And check out an example of an <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/issues/7">issue</a> we already have in GitHub, which is a potential future candidate for “Pay for Pull.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000"> “Pay for Pull” launches January 26th</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Starting January 26th, we will begin to label issues in our GitHub code repositories with ‘$1000’ and invite developers to engage, work and earn money. You will find the list of issues posted on the <a href="http://bcdevexchange.org/developers">BCDevExchange website here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To make this possible, we’ve worked with our finance and legal gurus on policy innovation. The process will be 100% open, safe and transparent with all the work and communications visible to everyone in GitHub.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000">This is an experiment</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Like all good experiments – we are following a scientific method to devise and prove our ideas. Our hypothesis is that the “Pay for Pull” process will provide a faster, more iterative way to develop technology. We get that this new method is not a cure all for the barriers the tech community experiences in working with government. But we’ve tested and validated “Pay for Pull” with developers; their feedback was positive enough to continue with the experiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Now it’s time to test our hypothesis in the wild. We want answers to questions like these. What is the Goldilocks size of work – not too big, not to small &#8211; for $1000? Is “Pay for Pull&#8221; a useful tool in the toolkit to help remove the barriers for the B.C. tech sector to work with government? We think it is, but now we need to prove it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000">We are not alone</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">When it comes to experimenting with new ways to collaborate on code development, we are not alone. Check out the experiment by our friends at 18F in Washington, D.C. who <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/06/micro-purchase-lessons/">ran a micro-purchase experiment using GitHub with one of their open source projects</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000">Spread the word</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000">What happens next depends a lot on you. We expect to discover we need to refine the idea before we can confidently remove the alpha stickers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To make this experiment fly, we need as many people to get involved as possible. Please participate in a “Pay for Pull,” share your feedback, and tell your friends about the experiment.</span></p>
