<p><span style="color: #000000">This week we published the code that powers the <a href="http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public">BC Data Catalogue</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/ckanext-bcgov">Province of B.C.’s GitHub</a> account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Getting the code into GitHub has been a pathfinder project for the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BC Developers’ Exchange (BCDevExchange)</a>. We have ‘learned by doing,’ developing new policy innovations to make it possible. In doing so, we have cleared the path for future government open source projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What is the BC Data Catalogue?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Launched last year, the <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/databcs-new-tip-top-data-stop/">BC Data Catalogue</a> (BCDC) lists more than 3,500 datasets, applications and APIs, including over 1500 datasets licensed for commercial use under the <a href="http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/local/dbc/docs/license/OGL-vbc2.0.pdf">Open Government License – BC </a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The BCDC is powered by open source software called <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network)</a>. Originally developed by the non-profit <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation<u> (OKFN)</u></a> for the Government of the United Kingdom, CKAN has been adopted by governments around the world, including the Government of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>CKAN License </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The OKFN provides CKAN software under the <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/">GNU Affero Public License v3.0</a> (AGPL). Specifically designed to foster collaboration, the AGPL is a ‘copy-left’ or share-a-like license. The license requires those who deploy the software to the web to share their code modifications, revisions and contributions back to the community under the same license terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Accordingly, we are sharing our CKAN code modifications back to the community via GitHub. Features we have added include a data dictionary that pulls schema descriptions directly from our database, linkages to web mapping applications, and integration of the Government of Canada’s open source Web Experience Toolkit that provides responsive design and multi-lingual and accessibility features. We hope some of the new features developed for the BCDC make their way back into the core code, or are leveraged by other developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Why Open Source?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Choosing CKAN places the Province in good company. More than <a href="http://ckan.org/instances/">115 governments and institutions around the globe</a> use CKAN for their data catalogues. Because code enhancements are shared, everyone using the software benefits from enhancements made by the community, creating a better product at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Community knowledge is another advantage of choosing open source software. We used <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan">GitHub</a><u>,</u> <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-dev">mailing lists</a>, <a href="http://irc.lc/oftc/ckan/">IRC channels</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com/search?q=ckan">forums</a><u> to </u>connect with a vibrant community of over 100 CKAN developers around the world. This developer community shared their experiences and advice on how to customize and implement the software to meet the Province’s requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>A Pathfinder</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">While the Province regularly uses open source software such as Apache to run web servers and the JQuery JavaScript library to build web-pages, choosing CKAN for the new catalogue is different because the Province will contribute our code modifications back to the CKAN community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To contribute code back required a number of policy innovations including the Province’s entry into GitHub, a move that sets the stage for government to collaborate with developers on future open source projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We modified contract language to create appropriate intellectual property rights to distribute the code under an open source license and to allow the vendor to work on open source code on behalf of government. These contract innovations can now be used by other B.C. government open source projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Get Involved</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Our next step is to explore how we use the BCDevExchange to expose our backlog of catalogue issues and enhancements so that people interested in helping can pitch in and help us learn to ‘develop in the open.’ Are you one of those people?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Do you have opinions on how we can do this?</span></p>
