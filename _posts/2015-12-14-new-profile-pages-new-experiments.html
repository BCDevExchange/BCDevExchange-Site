<p><span style="color: #000000">One of the challenges we are working on is how to present a public sector organization so the tech community can see <em>opportunit</em>ies, be they market opportunities, innovation opportunities or learning opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Our answer to that challenge is what we call the ‘profile page.’ These pages profile a public sector organization for the tech community audience. They explain what an organization does, who is on the team and what information technology projects they are working on. Profile pages also point to the organization&#8217;s digital resources, such as code or APIs, that are being made or shared. To put it another way, if <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca">www.gov.bc.ca</a> is the Government of B.C.’s public facing ‘front stage,’ a <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/home">BC Developers’ Exchange</a> profile is a digital backstage pass to help the tech community discover opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Recently we released 3 new profile pages—the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/Citizen%20Engagement%20Web%20Toolkit">Citizen Engagement Web Toolkit</a>,  <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/Environmental%20Reporting%20BC">Environmental Reporting BC</a> and one for the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/programs/BCDevExchange">BCDevExchange app</a>. The BCDevExchange profile page highlights the software code that runs the BCDevExchange website, all of which is under an open source license in GitHub, the popular code-sharing community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">On the BCDevExchange profile page, we’re introducing a new experiment – we are making all our work visible for anyone to see. Our team is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban board</a>, a tool that tracks the progress of work. On the BCDevExchange profile page, click on our <a href="https://waffle.io/BCDevExchange/BCDevExchange-app">Kanban board</a>, and you will see what we are working on broken down into <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/user-stories.html">user stories</a>, what we have done already, and what we plan to work on in the future (our <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/backlog.html">backlog</a>). The intention is to provide a way for developers outside the project to see our work so it is easier for them to find and pursue opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We recognize there are some challenges associated with making our workflow this open. For example, at times organizations we bring into the BCDevExchange may wish to keep their work plan behind closed doors to help ensure everything is in good shape before they create public awareness.  We will continue to evolve our ability to manage issues like this, while remaining committed to the <a href="https://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/how-to-deal-with-not-knowing-bcdevexchanges-4-principles/">BCDevExchange principle to maximize collaboration</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We believe that sharing what we are doing can become a platform for collaboration between the public and the tech sectors. We are excited about the possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It’s a hypothesis that has yet to be proven. The ultimate test is what <em>you</em> think. So have a look—we’d love to hear your ideas.</span></p>
