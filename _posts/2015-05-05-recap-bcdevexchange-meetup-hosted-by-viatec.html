<p><span style="color: #000000">Hosted and organized by <a href="http://www.viatec.ca/">ViaTec</a>, the turnout exceeded expectations with around 50 people in the room. The majority of attendees self-identified as developers, but there was also a solid contingent of entrepreneurs, open data enthusiasts and a handful of public servants.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The BCDevExchange Vision</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">They came to hear the <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/02/">vision</a> presented by project co-lead Peter Watkins of a new engagement model between B.C.’s public and tech sectors. This new model would clear the path for entrepreneurs to use B.C. public sector digital resources, such as code or data, and to have their tech innovations adopted back by government. In closing, Watkins summed up that the goal is for B.C. tech customers to take their tech products and services to the international market.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">What We Heard</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Following the presentation, there was a panel discussion with plenty of input from the audience. Like the <a href="https://www.opendatabc.ca/">OpenDataBC</a> meetup in Vancouver, we had key players in the Victoria tech scene volunteer to share their insights on our panel. There was founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.latitudegeo.com/">Latitude Geographics</a> Steven Myhill-Jones, entrepreneur and vice president of the non-profit OpenDataBC Kevin McArthur, and Tayo Runsewe of <a href="http://www.rkosolutions.com/">RKO Solutions</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The great ideas generated by the panel and audience members at the meetup will help guide the BCDevExchange as we move forward. There is not enough space to capture all of the gems, but here is a small sample of some of the stories and advice that really stood out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Our event moderator, entrepreneur and ViaTec COO Robert Bennett asked the panel to share their experience working with government and public sector digital resources. Myhill-Jones shared his story of growing his GIS mapping technology company from five people with the Province of B.C. as a first customer, to over 75 employees and more than 800 customers around the world. It was a perfect example of what the BCDevExchange wants to create on a repeatable basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">OpenDataBC’s McArthur expressed what a big deal it was that the <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/the-province-of-bc-on-github/">Province has joined GitHub</a>. He gave us good advice to get a “big project into GitHub and then invite the community to contribute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We heard a strong message from members of the audience who spoke about the need to get municipalities and other levels of government involved in the BCDevExchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Focus on the Business Problem First</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Another idea that resonated with us came from a member of the panel. Tayo Runsewe stressed the importance of not blindly focusing on the public sector’s digital resources. Instead he advocated we focus on the business problem first, and then try to find digital resources that may help support a technical solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">“Innovation is not just about the app,” Runsewe said. “It’s about how we engage with the public sector and how we engage on business models.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We think this is a key idea. What if the BCDevExchange unearths public sector business problems during what we call the “Discovery” phase long before a prescribed technical solution has been chosen? The BCDevExchange could publish personas, user stories and other artifacts for listed government programs so that entrepreneurs and developers can first understand program mandates and who the programs serve.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Get Involved</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you have ideas to share on the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> we would love to hear from you. Post a comment on this blog, or <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange">send us an issue in GitHub</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A big thank you to everyone who came out and contributed at ViaTec.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And stay tuned for news on the next BCDev meetup.</span></p>
