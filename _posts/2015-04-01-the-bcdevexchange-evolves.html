<p><span style="color: #000000">We’ve rolled out a few enhancements to</span> <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/">BCDevExchange.org</a> <span style="color: #000000">to better illustrate the direction of the project. We’ve added a search function for</span> <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/resources">Resources</a> <span style="color: #000000">and</span> <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/projects">Projects</a><span style="color: #000000">, and we’ve taken the covers off a <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/lab">Labs</a> concept. This is the first iteration of these ideas, and we expect they will further evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Discover Digital Resources</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We’ve heard from our engagement activities that people are sharing digital resources &#8211; code, APIs, applications and datasets &#8211; and we think that’s great. We’ve also heard that digital resources are often hard to find, which we think is bad. To help address this, we’ve added a Resource Search function on <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange.org</a> that can search across different sources for digital resources, including both</span> <a href="http://ckan.org/">Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network <span style="color: #000000">(CKAN)</span></a><span style="color: #000000"> data catalogues and</span> <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> <span style="color: #000000">code repositories. This sets the groundwork for an easier way to discover digital resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">For background, CKAN is open-source data cataloguing software used by DataBC, the <a href="http://data.surrey.ca/">City of Surrey</a>, and many national governments, including <a href="http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset">Canada</a>. CKAN has an API that lets us search and show digital resources on the BCDevExchange. The biggest code sharing community, GitHub has over 17 million code repositories, or repos.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Learn about Projects and Backlogs</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In support of our principles of open development and co-creation, we are posting Projects on BCDevExchange with openly visible and accessible development backlogs. We are using GitHub repos to hold projects with one repo per project, and the repo’s issue list as its backlog. A search function has been added to<a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home"> BCDevExchange.org</a> which calls a GitHub API and returns all repos tagged as projects. We want to make it easy for you to see what the dev team is up to and to share your ideas or suggestions through GitHub issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Experiment in the Labs</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We have created a separate Labs area accessible from <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange.org</a>. The thinking is for Labs to be a place to develop and share projects and ideas in an open and safe environment; where people know to expect things to be under construction and in a less than perfect, non-production state. In addition to providing a safe place to experiment, we are investigating different tools we can provide or recommend to members to help encourage their participation in the Labs. Right now, BCDevExchange is the primary occupant of the Lab, with sandbox (testing environment) versions of CKAN and <a href="http://wso2.com/api-management/">WSO2 API Manager</a> that support the <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/BCLaws-API-Management">BCLaws API Management project</a>. We are working to bring other projects into the Labs in the coming months, which will help us figure out exactly how we can best meet the needs of the wider community. Expect the Labs to change and evolve accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>What now?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Do you have a CKAN catalogue, or code in GitHub you’d like to share? <a href="mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca?subject=Feedback on BCDevExchange">Contact us</a> about how to get your digital resources listed on the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Interested in helping to shape the evolution of BCDevExchange? <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange">Find us on GitHub</a>, and check out our project repos and backlogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Come check out the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/lab">Labs</a>, and share your thoughts about how the concept could evolve.</span></p>
