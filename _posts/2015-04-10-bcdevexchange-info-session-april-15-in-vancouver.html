<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Looking Back on the BCDevExchange Discovery Day</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">On March 24-25<sup>th</sup> we were in Vancouver for a</span> <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/#/home">BCDevExchange</a> <span style="color: #000000">Discovery Day that focussed on how we can use technology to support public engagement in the Province. The event featured the</span> <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/index.html">BC Laws API</a> <span style="color: #000000">and the Province of B.C.’s use of WordPress and other technology to engage citizens, with the</span> <a href="http://engage.gov.bc.ca/liquorpolicyreview/">BC Liquor Policy Review</a> <span style="color: #000000">a prominent example.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As the featured digital resource, the BC Laws API demonstrated the possibilities for leveraging technology to engage citizens. A “wow” moment for the audience of public engagement professionals and technologists was getting a glimpse at the work that BC-based start-up</span> <a href="http://www.knomos.ca/">Knomos</a> <span style="color: #000000">is doing using the BC Laws API for visualizing and navigating legislation.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">What did we learn?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">The organizations represented at the event and the number of attendees signaled demand and interest in the opportunity to use public sector digital resources.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Participants identified shared business needs and specific opportunities to collaborate, supporting the premise of the BCDevExchange.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">The people with business problems don’t necessarily speak the same language as the technologist with solutions. The BCDevExchange needs to find efficient ways to bridge the language gap.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000">More Discovery Days are in the works. They are an opportunity to bring together a mix of public sector innovators, tech entrepreneurs and start-ups to explore the potential for digital resources, business needs and opportunities for innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Co-design Community Revs Up</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In keeping with</span> <a href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/bcdevexchange-adopts-agile/">our adoption of Agile Methodology</a><span style="color: #000000">, we also held our first co-design session on March 23<sup>rd</sup> in Victoria. Roughly 25 developers, entrepreneurs and public sector innovators participated.  In a lively and interactive workshop, participants provided valuable input into mapping the future of the BCDevExchange. Participants were particularly interested in the sharing of public sector digital resources and new ways to incentivize contributions, including code, from developers outside government. <a style="color: #000000" href="http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2015/03/the-province-of-bc-on-github/">Our entry into GitHub</a> represents the initial step to explore such collaborations.</span></p>
